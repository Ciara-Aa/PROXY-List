## Test http & https proxy using proxy_tester_menu.py

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the `requests` library installed. You can install it using `pip install requests` if needed.
2. Create two files named `http.txt` and `https.txt` in the same directory as the script. Each file should contain a list of IP addresses to test, with one IP per line.
3. Run the script using the command: `python proxy_tester_menu.py`.
4. The menu will be displayed, prompting you to select a file to test. Enter your choice by typing `1` or `2`.
5. If the chosen file is not found or empty, an error message will be displayed. Make sure the file contains valid IP addresses.
6. The script will start testing the IP addresses using the selected file. An animation will be displayed to indicate the progress of testing.
7. Once the testing is completed, the results will be saved in a file named `results.txt` in the same directory.
8. The message "Testing complete. Results are saved to results.txt" will be displayed.

Make sure to have the required `http.txt` and `https.txt` files in the same directory as the script and ensure they contain valid IP addresses.

If you have any issues or questions, feel free to ask.
