##Test http & https proxy using proxy_tester_menu.py

To use this  script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the `requests` library installed. You can install it using `pip install requests` if needed.
2. Add the `http.txt` and `https.txt` files in the same directory as the script. Each file should contain the respective IP addresses, with one IP per line.
3. Run the script using the command: `python proxy_tester_menu.py`.
4. The menu will be displayed, prompting you to select a file to test. Enter your choice by typing `1` or `2`.
5. The loading animation will be shown, followed by the progress of file completion.
6. The script will test the IP addresses from the chosen file and save the results to `results.txt` in the same directory.
7. Once completed, the message "Testing complete Successfully". Results Are saved to results.txt" will be displayed.
